        shortDescription: "A simple yet fun game created using OOP that involved moving a snake around the screen and collecting food items",
        description: "The first Python snake game that I created was a simple yet fun game that involved moving a snake around the screen and collecting food items. As I wrote the code and tested it out, I was amazed at how my knowledge of Python was being put into practice. I was able to see the immediate results of my efforts as the game started to come to life on the screen. \
        One of the things that made the game even more exciting for me was that I was able to put the concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) into practice. By creating classes for the snake, food, and scoreboard, I was able to organize my code and make it more modular.",

        shortDescription: "A flash card app GUI using Tkinter, designed to help users accelerate their language learning or study any other dual topic. The app presents a series of cards with information on one side, and the corresponding translation or answer on the other side.",
        description: "Creating a flashcards app using Tkinter was a great learning experience for me, especially since it was one of the first GUIs that I ever created. The app presents a series of cards with information on one side, and the corresponding translation or answer on the other side. Although the project was guided, I was able to gain a complete understanding of how GUIs work and solidify my knowledge of Python and the Tkinter library. This project allowed me to learn about the different aspects of developing a user-friendly interface, including the importance of customizability and ease-of-use.",

        title: "Stock price and news SMS alert",
        shortDescription: "This application is designed to send a customized SMS alert to the user whenever there is a significant change in the stock price",
        description: "In this guided project I developed a stock price alert application using the alphavantage, newsapi, and twilio APIs. This application is designed to send a customized SMS alert to the user whenever the price of a particular stock varies by a certain amount. The application also automatically triggers a request to find the most recent news about the company whose stock is being monitored. This information is included in the SMS alert along with the alert about the price change. Overall, this project provided an excellent opportunity for me to dive deeper into the world of APIs and gain a better understanding of their functionality. By integrating multiple APIs, I was able to create a sophisticated application that provides users with up-to-date information about their stock investments in real-time. The project also allowed me to develop my skills in coding, data analysis, and application development, making it a valuable experience overall.",

        shortDescription: "A bot that automates several steps and performs web scraping on the web using Selenium",
        description: "In this project, I created a bot script using Selenium that would navigate to the Speedtest website, run a speed test, retrieve the resulting data, and use that data to post a tweet on Twitter about the internet download and upload speeds. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that not only helped me to develop my skills in web scraping and automation but also provided me with the knowledge and tools to tackle similar projects in the future.",
